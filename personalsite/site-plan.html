        <br>
        Welcome to my projects page! As a web developer, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that have allowed me to showcase my skills and expertise. Below are some examples of my recent work:
        <br>

        <br>
        [Water Rafting Page]
        <br>

        <br>
        For this project, I was tasked with designing and developing a website for a water rafting company. The site needed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with information about the company, its services, and the different rafting trips available. I designed the site with a clean, modern look and made sure it was optimized for different screen sizes. I also integrated a booking system to make it easy for customers to reserve their spot on a trip.
        <br>
        <br>
        [Personal Portfolio]
        <br>

        <br>
        Creating my personal portfolio was a project I took on to showcase my skills and accomplishments. I designed and developed the site from scratch, making sure to highlight my strengths and experience in web developer. I used HTML, CSS, to create a responsive, user-friendly site that reflects my personal brand.
        <br>

        <br>
        I'm proud of the work I've done on these projects and the results they've achieved. Each project has allowed me to grow as a web developer and provided me with valuable experience. If you have any questions about the projects or would like to work together on a new project, please feel free to contact me. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to create exceptional solutions.
